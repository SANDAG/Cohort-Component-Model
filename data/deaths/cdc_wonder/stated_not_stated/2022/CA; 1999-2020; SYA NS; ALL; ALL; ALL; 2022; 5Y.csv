"3. The U.S. - Mexico Border Regions distinguish between counties near the U.S. - Mexico border in the border states of Arizona,"

"within the United States are available: 1) U.S. - Mexico Border Region (i.e., 44 counties within 100 kilometers (62 miles) of"
"the U.S. - Mexico border), and 2) the U.S. Non-Border Region with the remaining counties of the selected four border states. The"

"deaths, with a crude rate of approximately 41.0 per 100,000 population, and an age-adjusted rate of approximately 42.1 per"
