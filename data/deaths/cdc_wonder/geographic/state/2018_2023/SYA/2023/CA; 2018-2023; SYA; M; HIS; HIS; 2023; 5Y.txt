Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when they include a subset of ages 85-100+ because populations are not"
"available for those ages. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Ages 85-100."
"2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Unreliable."
"3. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Not Stated."
"4. Deaths of persons with Hispanic origin ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among"
"Hispanic Origin groups, so are not included in the Hispanic Origin specific counts and rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Not Stated."
"5. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"
"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:"

"8. The U.S. - Mexico Border Regions distinguish between counties near the U.S. - Mexico border in the border states of Arizona,"
"California, New Mexico, and Texas, and other areas. To simplify the Border region analysis, two mutually exclusive regions"
"within the United States are available: 1) U.S. - Mexico Border Region (i.e., 44 counties within 100 kilometers (62 miles) of"
"the U.S. - Mexico border), and 2) the U.S. Non-Border Region with the remaining counties of the selected four border states. The"
"Border counties selection was based on the 1983 La Paz Agreement:"
"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/lapazagreement.pdf.. (i.e., counties for each state which fall"
"within 100 kilometers of the Border). Statistics are also available by each of the USA border counties along the U.S.-Mexico"
"area."
"9. After the creation of the final 2023 dataset, North Carolina updated the cause of death information for over 900 death"
"certificates to include a cause of death code indicating drug overdose (ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes: X40-X44,"
"X60-X64, X85, and Y10-Y14). Jurisdictions can continue to update death certificates after the closing of the mortality file. As"
"a result, users should consider that the actual death count for drug overdose deaths for North Carolina in 2023 is over 4,400"
"deaths, with a crude rate of approximately 41.0 per 100,000 population, and an age-adjusted rate of approximately 42.1 per"
"100,000 population. These deaths will not be updated on the final mortality datasets."
