/* 
The purpose of this script is to count migration in and out of San Diego County by age, sex, and race/ethnicity from 5-year ACS PUMS 2006-2010 to 2018-2022.
 
-- Compile in and out migration by single year of age, sex, and race/ethnicity for San Diego County from 5-year ACS PUMS for all the years into one CTE.
-- Ensure fields exist in pums_persons for each variation of a variable, such as PUMA/PUMA00/PUMA10/PUMA20 and MIGPUMA/MIGPUMA00/MIGPUMA10/MIGPUMA20, by setting the fields to NULL when there is no data for that year.
-- Combine MIGSP05 and MIGSP12 variables, which are present 2008-2012 to 2011-2015, into MIGSP, which is present 2006-2010 to 2007-2011 and 2012-2016 to 2018-2022, because the code for CA (006/6) is the same throughout.
-- Remove active-duty military and persons who did not migrate.
